Hyatt Place East End is a dog-friendly hotel, so feel free to bring your canine friend along on your next visit! To ensure maximum comfort for all of our guests, following the departure of a guest and their pet, there are certain steps we must take to ensure the suite is clean and free from possible allergens. We deep clean carpets, drapes, bedspreads and other linens, and fumigate the suite. For this reason, we add the nonrefundable pet/cleaning fee to the account during check-in. GUIDELINES FOR DOG OWNERS: All dogs must be housebroken. Dogs must be on leashes when in public areas. Pets are not allowed in the food service areas and pool areas. Your pet must be confined in a carrier if left unattended during the cleaning of your room or you can arrange a time for our staff to clean the room at a time when you can remove your animal. Please note, guests may be asked to leave if repeated instances/complaints of barking. Please call our hotel at (631) 208 0002 prior to your arrival to let us know you’ll be bringing your dog(s)
